    "Our data consists of real-time market data (**order book** and **trade**) fetched from the [HTX Futures Exchange](https://www.htx.com/en-us/futures/linear_swap/exchange), focusing on the following trading pairs:\n",

    "### Why These Trading Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "All four trading pairs — **BTC-USDT**, **XRP-USDT**, **SOL-USDT**, and **ETH-USDT** — share the following characteristics in terms of **liquidity**, **stability**, and **value preservation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High Liquidity**  \n",
    "   These pairs are among the most actively traded on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. Their high trading volumes and deep order books ensure minimal slippage, tight bid-ask spreads, and efficient entry/exit for both institutional and retail traders.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relatively High Stability (Among Crypto Assets)**  \n",
    "   While all cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, these assets — especially BTC and ETH — are considered relatively stable compared to smaller altcoins. Their large market capitalizations and mature ecosystems contribute to lower intraday volatility and fewer flash crashes. USDT, as a stablecoin, also helps anchor the pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Strong Value Preservation Potential**  \n",
    "   These assets, particularly BTC and ETH, are widely regarded as long-term stores of value within the crypto space. BTC is often referred to as *“digital gold”*, and ETH powers the largest smart contract ecosystem. Even XRP and SOL, though more specialized, have shown resilience and regained value after market corrections."
